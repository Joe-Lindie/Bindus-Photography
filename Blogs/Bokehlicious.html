          <h3>Bokehlicious Photos</h3>
          <p>
            What is bokeh? How can we take bokehlicious photos? Today's quick
            photography tip from Bindus Photography is about how to use bokeh.
            Here is an example of a shot I took in Korea.
          </p>

          />

          <h3>What is bokeh?</h3>
          <p>
            Before we talk about bokeh, we need to understand aperture. In the
            most simple terms, it is the size of the opening in the lens.
          </p>

          <p>
            You measure aperture in f-stops, and each lens has a different
            range. My favourite bokeh lens is the 50mm f1.8. Its aperture range
            is f1.8 - f22. Its smallest aperture f1.8 is wide open, so it lets
            the maximum amount of light in and its largest aperture f22 is
            narrowest.
          </p>

          <p>
            A) F1.8 the lens opening is wide. <br />
            B) F22 the lens opening is narrow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we come to our question. What is bokeh? Bokeh is a Japanese word
            that refers to the soft out of focus areas of photographs. The lower
            the f-stop of your lens the better or more bokeh you'll be able to
            produce.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took this photo using the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L lens. It's
            excellent for isolating a subject and creating a soft out of focus
            area in the background. If you don't have a fast lens, you need to
            put as much distance between your subject and the background.
          </p>

          <p>How can we take bokehlicious photos?</p>
          <p>
            A) Open your lens as wide as possible. <br />
            B) Leave as much distance between your subject and the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this simple trick to isolate your subject and create
            bokehlicious photos. Stick around for more photography tips and
            tricks. I'll see you next time.
